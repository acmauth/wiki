# Wiki

This wiki is based on [gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/).

## Project hosting

The wiki is currently only available as a [Github project](https://github.com/acmauth/wiki).

The Markdown nature of the posts and Github's native Markdown interpretation make it easily browsable from the repository as well.

## Serving to localhost

In case you want to serve the wiki gitbook to your own computer, simply clone the project and provided you have gitbook installed, simply run:

```
gitbook serve
```

from the project's top-level directory.
The default serving address is localhost:4000.
