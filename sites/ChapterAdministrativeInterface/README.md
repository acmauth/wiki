# Chapter's Administration

The Chapter's administration is being done from the ACM's [Administrative Interface](https://www.acm.org/chapters/chapter-administrative-interface).

Simply log in with the chapters credentials, and you are greeted with the portal.

Here, you can:

* Add/Remove members
* Add chapter officers
* Change the chapter's information
* Submit reports to ACM (has to be done at an annual basis)
